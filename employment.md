RiverGlide is a collection of people sharing a fun, warm, and trusting culture where work is not a chore, it's a passion. We trust you to do the right thing and we want you to feel the same about RiverGlide. Below you will find some stuff that the lawyers make us say. We hope you feel that it all goes without saying but thanks to some bad people out there, laws have been made that mean we have to write this stuff down.

Terms of Employment:

This is a contract between {your name} (You) and RiverGlide Limited (Us/We).
The effective start date of this contract is 11th April 2011.
Your job title will be 'Riverglider'.
Payment for the work you do with Us is described in the Employee Handbook.


1. Your official place of work will be your home. You may be required to travel to another place of work, for example, a client site or to collaborate on an internal project.

3. The law entitles You to a minimum of 28 days of paid leave per year. This consists of 8 public holidays and 20 days of paid leave per year. We expect you to take at least the minimum amount of leave each year. We also encourage you to take as much additional leave as you need to maintain the health and well being of yourself and the company, as long as to do so would not cause harm to You, Us or any client We are engaged with. 
4. You are entitled to receive sick pay at a minimum of the current statutory rate. We reserve the right to pay you more at our discretion.
5. The grievance, dismissal and disciplinary policy is explained in the Employee Handbook. We hope that in your time with us neither We nor You will ever let things get to that.
